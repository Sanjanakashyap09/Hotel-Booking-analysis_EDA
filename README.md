Project Summary -
The hospitality industry is fiercely competitive, and hotels constantly seek to optimize their occupancy rates and revenue streams. To make informed business decisions, understanding booking patterns and factors
influencing customer preferences is crucial. This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to uncover key trends and influencing factors. Specifically, the project aims to explore the best time of year to 
book a hotel room, determine the optimal length of stay for cost-effectiveness, and identify predictors of a high number of special requests. By leveraging this data, hotels can enhance their pricing strategies, 
improve customer satisfaction, and optimize operational efficiency.

The dataset used in this project contains booking information for two types of hotels: a city hotel and a resort hotel. The data includes various attributes such as booking dates, length of stay, number of guests, 
room type, meal plan, and the number of special requests. All personally identifiable information has been removed to ensure privacy. Key columns in the dataset include hotel (type of hotel), is_canceled
(whether the booking was canceled), lead_time (number of days between booking and arrival), arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month, arrival_date_day_of_month (details of the arrival date), stays_in_weekend_nights,
stays_in_week_nights (number of weekend and weekday nights stayed), adults, children, babies (number of adults, children, and babies), meal (type of meal booked), country (country of origin of the guests),
reserved_room_type, assigned_room_type (reserved and assigned room type), booking_changes (number of changes made to the booking), deposit_type (type of deposit made), agent, company (booking agent and company), 
days_in_waiting_list (number of days the booking was on the waiting list), customer_type (type of customer), adr (average daily rate), required_car_parking_spaces (number of required car parking spaces), 
and total_of_special_requests (number of special requests made by the guest).

The project aims to achieve several key objectives. First, it seeks to identify the best time of year to book a hotel room to secure the most favorable rates. Second, it aims to determine the optimal length of
stay that results in the best daily rate for guests. Third, the project focuses on predicting whether a booking is likely to have a disproportionately high number of special requests. Additionally, the project
will explore other significant factors that influence booking behavior, such as lead time, cancellation rates, and customer demographics.
